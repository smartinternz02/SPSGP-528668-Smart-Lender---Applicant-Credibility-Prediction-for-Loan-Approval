Smart Lender - Applicant Credibility Prediction for Loan Approval
Smart_Lender_project A loan is the major source of income for the banking sector of financial risk for banks. 
Large portions of bank's assets directly come from the interest earned on loans given.
The activity of lending loans carry great risks including the inability of borrower to pay back the loan by the stipulated time. 
It is referred as "credit risk".
The primary goal of this search is to extract patterns from a common loan approved dataset, and then build a model based on these extracted patterns. 
The historical data of the customers will be used in order to do the analysis.
Later on, some analysis will also be done to find the most relevant attributes, i.e.,the factors that affect the prediction result the most.
Machine Learning techniques are very crucial and useful in the prediction of these types of data. 
We will be using classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Random Forest, KNN, Xgboost model and Support vector machine. 
We will train and test the data with these algorithms.
Among all the algorithms Xgboost Model is selected and used to predict the loan by using python flask.
